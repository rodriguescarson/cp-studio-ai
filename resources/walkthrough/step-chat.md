# AI Chat Assistant

The sidebar chat is context-aware:

- **Problem statement** is included automatically
- **Your code** is sent with each message
- **Test results** can be discussed

Try asking:
- "What's wrong with my solution?"
- "How can I optimize this?"
- "Explain the approach for this problem"
- "What edge cases am I missing?"

Press **Ctrl+Shift+I** (Cmd+Shift+I on Mac) to toggle the chat.
