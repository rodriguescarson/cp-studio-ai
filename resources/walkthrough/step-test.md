# One-Click Testing

After writing your solution:

1. Click the **Play** button in the editor toolbar
2. Or press **Ctrl+Shift+T** (Cmd+Shift+T on Mac)

CP Studio will:
- Compile your code (C++, Python, or Java)
- Run it against all test cases
- Show pass/fail results with diff view
- Display runtime and memory usage

Add custom test cases with the **+** button in the toolbar.
