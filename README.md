## 🔧 Requirements

### Required

- **VS Code** 1.80+ or **Cursor** (any version)
- **C++ Compiler** (`g++` recommended, or `cl.exe` on Windows)

### Optional

- **AI API Key** - For AI features (get from [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai))
- **Codeforces Account** - For profile and solved problems tracking

### System Requirements

- **macOS**: 10.13+ (High Sierra or later)
- **Linux**: Ubuntu 18.04+, Fedora 30+, or any modern distribution
- **Windows**: Windows 10 or later
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended)
- **Disk Space**: ~200MB for extension + compiler

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working

- **Check VS Code version**: Requires 1.80+
- **Reload window**: `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window"
- **Check Output**: View → Output → Select "CP Studio"

### Tests Not Running

- **Verify compiler**: Run `g++ --version` in terminal
- **Check file location**: Must be in `contests/{contestId}/{problem}/main.cpp` (or `leetcode/` or `geeksforgeeks/`)
- **Check test files**: Ensure `in.txt` and `out.txt` exist

### AI Features Not Working

- **Check API key**: Settings → `codeforces.aiApiKey`
- **Verify key is valid**: Test at [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
- **Check account balance**: Ensure API account has credits

### Profile Not Loading

- **Verify username**: Settings → `codeforces.username`
- **Check internet**: Ensure Codeforces API is accessible
- **Try refresh**: `Cmd+Shift+P` → "CP Studio: Refresh Profile"

### Logo Display Issues

If the CP Studio logo appears white or not displaying properly:

- **Activity Bar Icon**: The logo should appear in the activity bar (left sidebar). If it's white, try:
  - Reload window: `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window"
  - Check if logo file exists: `resources/logo.png`
  - Ensure logo has transparent background (PNG format)
  
- **Editor Toolbar Icons**: Editor toolbar buttons use VS Code's codicons which automatically adapt to your theme. If icons appear white:
  - Try switching to a dark theme (recommended: One Dark Pro or Dracula)
  - Check theme contrast settings
  - Icons should automatically match your theme's foreground color

- **Theme Compatibility**: CP Studio's logo is optimized for dark themes. For best results, use one of the recommended cyber-professional themes listed in the Theme Suggestions section.

- ✅ **Local Storage**: All data stays on your machine
- ✅ **Encrypted Keys**: API keys stored securely in VS Code settings
- ✅ **HTTPS Only**: All API calls use secure connections
- ✅ **BYOK Model**: You provide your own API keys
